# My portfolio website repo
This repo is my portfolio project for my Provesional Development module for Staffordshire university.

Below are a a collection of youtube videos by one of the lecturers showing how to get a project online and how to edit it. There is also a video that shows how to write a README file and wwhy they are important when getting your repo social media ready.

Any issues feel free to get in touch.
